# Password Generator

## The User Story

As the title suggests, this app is a password generator. When a user clicks on the "Generate Password," the site responds with a prompt asking, "How many characters?". The response to this prompt must be between the values of 8 and 128, otherwise an alert will appear stating, "Character length must be 8 or more. Please try again". If the character input falls within the parameters of 8 and 128, the user will be greeted with a message stating, "Great choice!".

After the first prompt, the user will sequentially encounter four different messages asking them to confirm the specifics of their password. The confirmation prompts are as follows: "Click OK to confirm if you would like to include lowercase characters", "Click OK to confirm if you would like to include uppercase characters", "Click OK to confirm if you would like to include numeric characters", and "Click OK to confirm if you would like to include special characters". Thus, the order of these prompts are 1)Confirming lowercase characters, 2) Confirming uppercase characters, 3) Confirming numeric characters, and 4) Confirming special characters.

Once all of the prompts have been answered, a password that meets all of the user's criteria will be generated and ready for use.
